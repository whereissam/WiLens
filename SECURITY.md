# WiLens Security & Privacy

WiLens is a small, open-source macOS utility that scans a Wi‑Fi QR code with your
camera and joins the network for you. This page explains exactly what it does,
what it does **not** do, and how we keep it safe — so you can install it with
confidence.

**TL;DR:** WiLens runs entirely on your Mac. It has no servers, no accounts, no
analytics, and no network calls of its own. Your camera images, Wi‑Fi names, and
passwords never leave your computer. The full source code is in this repository.

## What WiLens does

1. Opens your Mac's camera (with your permission) to look for a Wi‑Fi QR code.
2. Reads the standard `WIFI:` QR payload (network name, password, security type).
3. Asks macOS to join that network using Apple's built-in CoreWLAN API.

That's the whole app. There is no cloud component.

## What WiLens does NOT do

- ❌ **No tracking.** No analytics, telemetry, ads, or crash reporting.
- ❌ **No accounts.** No sign-up, login, or email collection.
- ❌ **No data collection.** Camera frames, network names, and passwords are
  processed in memory on your Mac and are never uploaded anywhere.
- ❌ **No background activity.** It only does something while the window is open
  and you press a button.
- ❌ **No location tracking.** macOS *requires* Location permission before **any**
  app is allowed to read Wi‑Fi network details — this is an Apple OS rule, not a
  WiLens feature. WiLens never reads, stores, or transmits your location.

## Permissions it asks for, and why

| Permission | Why it's needed | Declared in |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Camera** | To scan the Wi‑Fi QR code. | [`Info.plist`](src-tauri/Info.plist) → `NSCameraUsageDescription` |
| **Location (While Using)** | macOS blocks reading Wi‑Fi network details unless Location is granted. Used only to find and join the network you scanned. | [`Info.plist`](src-tauri/Info.plist) → `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` |

You can revoke either permission at any time in **System Settings → Privacy &
Security**.

## How your data is handled

- **Camera images** are decoded locally by the QR scanner in your Mac's browser
  engine and discarded immediately. They are never saved to disk or sent over a
  network.
- **Wi‑Fi passwords** are passed straight to macOS to join the network. WiLens
  does **not** log them — application logs record only the network name and which
  join method was used (see [`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`](src-tauri/src/lib.rs)).
- The connection is added to your Mac's normal Wi‑Fi settings, exactly as if you
  had typed it in yourself.

## How WiLens is built to be safe

WiLens is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app) app: a Rust core with a sandboxed web
front-end. We apply several layers of defense:

- **No remote code.** A strict Content Security Policy (`script-src 'self'`) means
  the app can only run code shipped inside it — it cannot load or execute scripts
  from the internet. (See [`tauri.conf.json`](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json).)
- **Minimal capabilities.** The front-end is granted only Tauri's default
  permissions — no file-system, shell, or arbitrary-network access.
  (See [`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`](src-tauri/capabilities/default.json).)
- **Input is sanitized.** Data read from a QR code is untrusted, so the Rust core
  validates it before use: it rejects control characters and values that could be
  misread as command-line flags (argument injection), and only allows known
  Wi‑Fi security types. (See `sanitize_required` / `normalize_security` in
  [`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`](src-tauri/src/lib.rs).)
- **No string-built shell commands.** When the system join helper is used, every
  value is passed as a separate, escaped argument — never concatenated into a
  shell string.
- **No secrets in the code.** There are no API keys, tokens, or passwords in the
  source or build.

## Keeping dependencies safe

- Every push and pull request runs an automated **dependency vulnerability audit**
  (`bun audit` for the front-end, `cargo audit` for Rust) in
  [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml). As of the latest run, **0 known vulnerabilities**.
- **Dependabot** ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml)) opens
  automatic update PRs weekly for npm, Cargo, and GitHub Actions dependencies.
- The continuous-integration pipeline also runs type checks, linting
  (`cargo clippy -D warnings`), and the full test suite on every change.

## "Is this a scam / malware?"

It's a fair question to ask of any app you download. Here's how you can verify
WiLens yourself:

- **Read the code.** The entire app is open source in this repository — it's small
  enough to review in an afternoon. The core logic is a few hundred lines of Rust
  and TypeScript.
- **Build it yourself.** You don't have to trust our download. Clone the repo and
  run `bun install && cargo tauri build` to produce your own copy.
- **Check the network.** Run it behind Little Snitch / LuLu (or
  `nettop`) and you'll see WiLens makes no outbound connections of its own.
- **No installer tricks.** It's a normal `.dmg` — drag to Applications, no scripts,
  no admin password required for normal use.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Found a security issue? Let me know any way that's easiest — open a pull request
with a fix, file an issue, or use GitHub's
[private security advisory](https://github.com/whereissam/WiLens/security/advisories/new)
if you'd rather keep it private. I'll try to respond within a few days.

release. Because the project is open source, you can always verify these claims
against the code itself.*
